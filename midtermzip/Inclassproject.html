<p>Over the years, U.S. Route 1 in College Park, Md. experienced a change over the past 30 years, especially in its nightlife. 
<br><br>
Back in the 1980s, College Park graced its students, alumni and visitors with bars and restaurants where they came together on the weekends. Although that hasn’t changed wildly now in the present, the bars did. 
<br><br>
The three standing bars that attracted many customers included Santa Fe Cafe a white-brick building that stood at two levels and housed a large dance floor and open bar, The Rendezvous Inn, another two-level bar a bit smaller than the former, and R.J. Bentley’s, a single-floor restaurant and bar, walls covered with sports memorabilia showing off the Maryland Terps.

</p>


<br>
<p>
Harry Scott, the founder of The Rendezvous Inn, also known as The Vous, was a University of Maryland alumnus, graduating with a business degree in supply chain management. Scott had such a life-changing experience at the university, that he felt as though he needed to give back to the future students. 
<br><br>
“Founding and owning this bar has been one of my proudest achievements since graduating from Maryland,” said Scott. “I always appreciated the fun of the college experience, and wanted future students to feel the same as well.”
<br><br>
After owning The Vous for multiple years, he passed the ownership down to his daughter, another Maryland alumnus, Penny Scott. 
<br><br>
“It was an honor to take over my father’s business,” Penny said. “It was so important to him that The Vous stayed in the family, and I did not hesitate to take the opportunity.”
<br><br>
Unfortunately, in 1997, after a mix of police investigations and a huge flood, The Vous shut down. The community was disappointed by this news, but Santa Fe Cafe swooped in and gained momentum for their business. 

</p>

<p>
Santa Fe Cafe, founded by a former University of Maryland professor, took over the nightlife scene. Dr. Angela Martin, a professor of plant sciences for over 25 years, lost her passion and looked for more exciting opportunities. At 55, she opened the bar and it grew ever since. Her first special was a mint shot infused with sage that she grew in the garden behind the bar. 
</p>


<div class="callout calloutStyle">“Ang has been such a role model for me and what I would like to pursue in the business industry,” former Horticulture Club President Betsy Anderson commented. “Her creativity and awesome deals were such a highlight of my college experience.” </div> 

<p>Due to pesticide poisoning, Martin died, and Santa Fe Cafe held a memorial in her honor before they permanently closed. </p>


<p>
In recent years, Cornerstone Grill & Loft replaced The Vous, and Terrapins Turf replaced Santa Fe Cafe. The two bars grew in popularity and lines wrap around the streets every single night of the week. Fences were made to contain the overly eager students filling up the lines each night, especially on the weekends. 
<br><br>
“Without these places, college would be such a bust,” Brett Newman, a graduate student, said. “If I had to describe them in three words, I’d say ‘lit, crazy, movie.’”

<br>
<p>The one bar that has ousted them all was founded in 1930 by Roger James Bentley called <a href="https://rjbentleys.net/" target="_blank">R.J. Bentleys.</a> He was a known legend throughout Old Town after founding the first fraternity on campus Alpha Alpha Alpha, known colloquially as “Tri-Alpha.” Students and professors alike urged him to open a bar on Route 1, to which he prevailed. 
<br><br>
“How could I disappoint my fans,” Bentley joked in an interview with the New York Times 20 years ago. “It is an honor to have touched so many people’s lives on and off-campus. Generations and generations.”
<br><br>
Nightlife continues to stay persistent in College Park and doesn’t seem to be ending soon.
