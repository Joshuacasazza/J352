<p>A small Catholic school in Cumberland, Md., was in danger of closing its doors. So Bishop Walsh School turned to its historically mediocre boys’ basketball team. 
<br><br>
Enrollment was on the decline at the K-12 school, according to Bishop Walsh president Joe Carter. To spark a turnaround, the school decided to beef up its basketball program with high-level talent.
<br><br>
“We were really, really low,” Carter said. “So, the idea was, let’s bring these kids in, put more bodies in the seats and see how it goes.”

</p>
<p>
Carter called on Dan Prete to start the rebuild.
<br><br>
A well-known high school coach in Maryland, Prete began coaching basketball in 1996. He was the associate head boys’ varsity coach at Montrose Christian School in Rockville from 2001-2013, then served as the head boys’ varsity coach at Saint James School in Hagerstown from 2013-2018.
<br><br>
During Prete’s time at Montrose Christian, 36 of the players became NCAA Division I scholarship athletes, including NBA star Kevin Durant. In his time at Saint James, nine players earned Division I scholarships. 
<br><br>
Before Prete’s arrival in 2018, Bishop Walsh struggled to find success on the court.
<br><br>
The Alhambra Catholic Invitational Tournament (ACIT) served as a microcosm of its mediocrity. The ACIT started in 1961, and Bishop Walsh was founded in 1966. In more than 50 years of competition, the school had never won more than one game in the tournament in a single year.

</p>


<div class="callout calloutStyle">“Our basketball program was just terrible,” Carter said.  </div> 

<p>
However, in Prete’s first season with Bishop Walsh in 2018-2019, the team improved from a 9-12 record the previous season to 20-8. The Spartans finished first in their local division for the first time since the 2012-2013 season, and they bolstered their schedule with games against teams from New York, Vermont, Delaware, Kansas and Utah. 
</p>

<p>Prete also brought an international flair to the program. He has traveled internationally to coach basketball camps twice, to Morocco in 2013, and to Brazil in 2019, and he maintains an international network of coaching contacts. </p>


<p>
Bishop Walsh guard Vilius Slanina hails from Lithuania, and he ended up at the school through one of Prete’s connections.
<br><br>
“I moved to the United States this August, two weeks before the start of school,” Slanina said.

<br>
<p>The one bar that has ousted them all was founded in 1930 by Roger James Bentley called <a href="https://rjbentleys.net/" target="_blank">R.J. Bentleys.</a> He was a known legend throughout Old Town after founding the first fraternity on campus Alpha Alpha Alpha, known colloquially as “Tri-Alpha.” Students and professors alike urged him to open a bar on Route 1, to which he prevailed. 
<br><br>
The 2021-22 roster featured several other international players, including Maor Nekrashevich from Israel and Myles Hosten from the United Kingdom. The international students live in a dormitory with the rest of their teammates and some other Bishop Walsh students. 
<br><br>
The chemistry that the Spartans have built can be, in part, attributed to strong leadership from Prete. 
<br><br>
“On and off the court, he's a great coach, great guy,” Bishop Walsh guard Mike Williams said about coach Prete. “He's there to teach you life skills, basketball, everything, anything you need. You can call him and ask no matter what time of day it is.”
<br><br>
The coach does more than recruit. He also got Bishop Walsh’s foot in the door of a newly minted basketball league called the National Interscholastic Basketball Conference (NIBC).<br><br>
When many high school basketball leagues were shut down in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, elite teams began looking for ways to play each other.<br><br>
Rashid Ghazi, the commissioner of the NIBC, helped such teams connect, and in the aftermath of that experience, he formed the league in May 2021.<br><br>
The first five teams to join the NIBC were Oak Hill Academy, Montverde Academy, La Lumiere School, Sunrise Christian Academy and Legacy School — all teams with histories of success on the court. For example, Florida’s Montverde Academy has featured top draft picks including Ben Simmons, R.J. Barrett, D’Angelo Russell and Cade Cunningham.<br><br>
Prete’s coaching history and his familiarity with other coaches helped boost Bishop Walsh’s profile and earned the school a spot in the NIBC, according to Ghazi. Although Bishop Walsh doesn’t have the basketball legacy of some of the other schools in the eight-team league, Ghazi saw potential in the Spartans program.<br><br>
Along with Prete and Ghazi, Carter and Jennifer Flinn, the principal of Bishop Walsh, played big roles in the move to the NIBC.<br><br>
“The year before, we played some of those teams,” Flinn said. “We talked about what a great opportunity it could be… It was something we certainly talked about to try and make the right decision for the school, to make sure it was going to be the right choice.”<br><br>

<p>The move to the NIBC attracted more eyes to the Bishop Walsh basketball program and to the school. Out of the 38 NIBC games in the inaugural 2021-22 season, seven were nationally televised on ESPNU while the remaining 31 were streamed on ESPN+. Eight of Bishop Walsh’s games were streamed on ESPN+ while the Spartans' game against Sunrise Christian was on ESPNU.  <br><br>
Bishop Walsh finished 1-9 against NIBC competition in the debut season, with its only win coming against Wasatch Academy. While not ideal, the slow start was not unexpected.<br><br>
“We also recognize that every team's not going to be Montverde, IMG or Sunrise,” Ghazi said. “There will be teams that are in the middle, teams at the bottom and teams at the top, and sometimes those middle or bottom teams may have a great year.”<br><br>
The stiff competition is what Bishop Walsh signed up for when it decided to become an elite program. The school signed a two-year contract with the NIBC, Carter said, and the league’s expectation is that the Spartans continue to get more competitive each year.<br><br>
“I think Bishop Walsh is in a great position to continue in the league for a long time,” Ghazi said. “We just have to see how they do over the next two or three years.”<br><br>
The schools that make up the NIBC are loaded with talent. In 2020 and 2021, there were five McDonald's All-Americans across the eight teams that would join the conference. In 2022, there were nine.<br><br>
“So, you’re seeing the best of the best night in and night out,” Bishop Walsh assistant basketball coach Lafayette Dublin said. “There are no nights off.”<br><br>

Following the first season in the NIBC, the Spartans returned to the familiar ACIT.<br><br>
Bishop Walsh faced powerhouse DeMatha High School out of Hyattsville in the first round of the tournament. In 2017, the Spartans were blown out by DeMatha in the first round by a score of 100-26.<br><br>
This year, though, Bishop Walsh put up a fight, falling 61-57 in a closely contested game with the Stags, who went on to win the tournament title.<br><br>
“In the history of Bishop Walsh, 60 years of the Alhambra tournament, they have never come that close [while] playing a DeMatha team,” Prete said to his team in the locker room after the loss. “You are forcing the issue of us being the pioneers for this program to explode. I want you to take pride in what we just did.”<br><br>
The Spartans went on to beat Bishop McNamara, 47-46, in the first round of the consolation bracket. Cumberland native Mikey Allen Jr. hit a 3-pointer as time expired to steal the win against the Forestville school.<br><br>
Allen’s father, Mikey Allen Sr., is an assistant coach for Bishop Walsh. He has seen the program play in 10 ACIT tournaments. He knows just how far the team has come.<br><br>
“The sky is the limit,” Allen Sr. said. “Coach Prete is the ultimate mentor. He does so much for the school and has brought so much to this community. I’m going to trust whatever direction he gives us to go.”<br><br>
In the championship of the consolation bracket, Bishop Walsh took on Mount Saint Joseph out of Baltimore. The Spartans emerged victorious, 71-70, off a second straight buzzer-beater 3-pointer by Allen Jr.<br><br>
The win marked the first time Bishop Walsh has won two games in the ACIT.<br><br>
Since Prete joined the school in 2018, enrollment has gone from below 300 to around 375 students, according to Carter. The high school has seen an increase in enrollment from the basketball players who have transferred to the school, according to Flinn.<br><br>
With the triumphant ending to the season, Bishop Walsh — as a school and a basketball program — showed how far it has come in just a few years.<br><br>
“I just know how hard these kids have worked,” Carter said. “I just want [the] Bishop Walsh program to be the best. We’re on our way.”</p>
