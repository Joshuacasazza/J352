<p>Streaming versus cable: It’s an ongoing, ever-changing battle. And your 
hard-earned dollars hang in the balance. <br><br>
With prices in flux and providers increasingly trying to emulate their 
competition, navigating the conflict can be a messy endeavor.
It can be deceptively difficult to figure out whether switching to a 
streaming TV service or sticking with a traditional paid-TV provider would 
be cheaper for you. <br><br>
Here’s how to navigate the growing number of viewing options without 
tripping on a land mine that will blow your budget:
</p>

<!--I thought there were too many short paragraphs in original story, so I changed it up-->
<h3>Don’t forget the internet</h3>

<p>
The cost of streaming TV is more than just the amount you pay to a 
streaming service like Netflix or Hulu every month.
To stream video, you need an internet connection. And that means you’ll be 
bowing before the likes of Comcast and AT&T, which could really cost you 
if you want high-speed internet access.
As there are different internet packages and speeds, you may be asking 
which one is right for you. For this answer, you’ll have to consult the 
streaming services you want to subscribe to and consider what stream 
quality you want to pay for. <br><br>
Netflix, for example, recommends that you have an internet download speed 
of 5 megabits per second (Mbps) per stream for HD quality video, and 25 
Mbps per stream for Ultra HD quality.
If you want to stream on multiple devices simultaneously, you’ll need even 
more megabits per second. For example, you’d need 10 Mbps to stream HD 
quality Netflix video on two devices at the same time.
Once you determine how much speed you need, check with your local service 
providers to see who’s offering it for the best price. And for more tips 
to save money on internet service, check out “8 Ways to Cut Your Internet 
Costs Every Month.”
</p>
<h3>Beware the real cost of a la carte options</h3>
<p>
Can you truly replace cable with streaming, channel for a channel? 
Technically, it’s possible. But if you must have an array of channels, you 
will likely have to subscribe to multiple streaming services.
This means that if you can get by with only the internet and Netflix, you 
will likely save money by ditching cable. But households with diverse 
tastes may find cable to be cheaper than subscribing to multiple streaming 
services. <br><br>
Let’s take a look at what a full streaming lifestyle could cost a 
hypothetical family:
<!--Almost didn't use the list but I love how it turned out-->
<ul>
<li>Dad wants his sports through Hulu’s Live TV subscription plan. It runs 
$54.99 a month.</li>
<li>Mom wants Amazon originals, Showtime and HBO dramas. To access Amazon 
originals, she will need a Prime membership, which costs at least $119 a 
year (about $9.92 a month). For Showtime and HBO, Mom can add individual 
channel subscriptions to her Prime membership or to Dad’s Hulu Live TV 
subscription. Either way, it will cost an extra $10.99 and $14.99 a month, 
respectively. That brings Mom’s monthly total to $35.90. </li>
<li>The kids want to stream cartoons. Dad’s Hulu Live TV subscription includes 
access to channels like Cartoon Network, so the family doesn’t necessarily 
have to pay extra for the kids’ cartoons.</li>
<li>The whole family wants “Star Trek: Picard,” which is available on CBS All 
Access, the network’s own streaming service. A subscription costs $5.99 a 
month for the limited-commercial plan or $9.99 for the commercial-free 
plan.</li></ul>
<!--Perfect finishing line to do a callout in my opinion-->
<div class="callout calloutStyle">The brings the total cost of streaming entertainment to $95.88 or $99.88 a 
month for our hypothetical family — not counting the cost of their 
internet service.</div> <p>So, clearly, choosing streaming services a la carte 
could add up fast for some households.</p>
</p>
<h3>Learn all your options</h3>
<p>
To determine whether streaming TV services could truly replace your 
current cable or satellite TV package — and how much it would cost you — 
you must first decide which shows and channels you cannot live without. 
Make a list.
<br><br>
Then, find out which streaming services offer those shows or channels and 
how much they cost. Consult free online resources like The Streamable’s 
channel comparison tool for help.
Here’s another tip: Many streaming services don’t have contracts, meaning 
you can cancel a subscription at any time. So, you could try out one 
service at a time at minimal cost.
<br><br>
For example, watch Hulu originals for a month or two. Then, cancel it and 
try out Netflix.
Another no-contract option: Forget streaming altogether. Instead, check 
out DVD Netflix, a DVD-by-mail rental service owned by Netflix.
If you’re a Blu-ray binge-watcher, you could subscribe to DVD Netflix’s 
$14.99-per-month Premier plan and get unlimited rentals with the ability 
to check out two discs at a time. One caveat: You need patience, as it can 
take a while for movie releases to come to DVD.
</p>
<h3>The bottom line</h3>
<p>
Walking away from cable can save you hundreds of dollars a year, if not 
more. But walking away from the prerecorded laugh tracks and the 
background roars of game-day crowds can be tough.
The right choice for you depends on your preferences, priorities and 
budget. So, you need to take the time to explore the options, compare 
prices and consider what’s most important to you.
Oh, and unless you give up TV entirely, you also need to stay on top of 
bill changes and new specials being offered.
